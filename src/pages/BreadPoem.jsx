                    <div>In a room where echoes sing,
                        Voices rise on feathered wing,
                        Scales ascend and arpeggios fall,
                        Breath in rhythm, hearts enthrall.

                    <div>
                        Diaphragms like bellows strong,
                        Sustain the notes, prolong the song,
                        Resonance in chest and head,
                        Harmonies in tones widespread.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Diction clear as crystal streams,
                        Shapes the words of poets' dreams,
                        Every vowel, every phrase,
                        Crafted in a timeless daze.

                        Exercises, daily done,
                        Forge the art where passions run,
                        Operaâ€™s soul in practice found,
                        In each voice, a world unbound.
